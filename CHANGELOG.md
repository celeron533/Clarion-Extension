### Added
- Enhanced "Go To Definition" functionality for included files (`INCLUDE('FileName.clw')` or class `MODULE('FileName.clw')`). The extension uses the Redirection file logic to locate and open the specified file in the editor, regardless of whether it's in the workspace or not.
- Workspace settings and commands:
  - **Command: Clarion Configure ClarionProperties.xml File**
    Use this command to configure the `ClarionProperties.xml` file for your workspace. Access settings via "File" > "Preferences" > "Settings".
  - **Command: Clarion Select Application Solution File**
    This command assists in selecting your application's solution file.

### Changed

### Fixed

### New Features
#### Go To Definition for Included Files

- Improved hover support, showing previews of file contents.

## [0.3.4]
### Fixes
- Activation could try to take place even if workspace not trusted.

  - Folding provider now supports **natural folding for inline conditionals and single-line procedures**.

- **Future Plans for Customizable Folding**
  - Planned feature for **user-defined folding preferences**, allowing users to choose which items to fold.
